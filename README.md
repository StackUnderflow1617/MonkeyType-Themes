# MonkeyType-Themes
A list of themes I like for the typing website: monkeytype.com!


## Catppuccin

Looks like dark mode with a nice light green colours for the statistics. Honestly, it looks pretty simple though I can't say it is a bad thing since monkeytype is minimalistic typing website. *8.94/11*

## Ryujinscales

Looks nice with the orange and yellow(ish) colours and the name "ryujinscales" just sounds nice anyway. Honestly I would recommend this theme for people who like dark mode and also kind of "dragony" because of the name. *9.8/11*

## Trance
![trance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StackUnderflow1617/MonkeyType-Themes/src/TRANCE.png)

A theme similar to the RGB background as when applied it will have a gradient of colour from a spectrum of purple. Nice dark mode I guess. *9.4/11*

## Aurora

Just like Trance, it is a gradient-type background. Honestly, it has more "nice" colours for me than Trance so I would recommend this one more than Trance of Ryujinscales. *10/11*

## Fire

In the color of fire! Pretty obvious honestly. Similar to ryujinscales expect that it changes color like RGB. *9.5/11*

## Sewing Tin
