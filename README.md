# MonkeyType-Themes
A list of themes I like for the typing website: monkeytype.com!


## Catppuccin

Looks like dark mode with a nice light green colours for the statistics. Honestly, it looks pretty simple though I can't say it is a bad thing since monkeytype is minimalistic typing website. *8.94/10*

## Ryujinscales

Looks nice with the orange and yellow(ish) colours and the name "ryujinscales" just sounds nice anyway. Honestly I would recommend this theme for people who like dark mode and also kind of "dragony" because of the name. *9.8/10*
